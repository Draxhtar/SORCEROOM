## About the Project
Sorceroom is a fast-paced roguelike action game where players clear rooms filled with enemies to unlock power-ups and progress through a magical dungeon. Defeating all enemies causes the magic system of the room to collapse, opening doors and granting access to new areas and upgrades.

## How it Fits the Theme
In Sorceroom, each room represents a mini-dungeon where magic is used to lock players in until all creatures are defeated. Once the enemies are gone, the magic system is disrupted, opening the doors and revealing treasure chests with power-ups.

## Gameplay
- **Objective**: Defeat all enemies in a room to unlock new areas and gain power-ups.
- **Progression**: The difficulty increases as you move deeper into the dungeon, with more challenging enemies and rewarding upgrades.

## Features
- It is not procuderally generated.
- Dynamic combat with melee weapons.
- Power-up system for enhancing the playerâ€™s stats.
- Custom sound design and animations.
- Pre-made models for enemies and environment, with custom assets created for sound, animation, and music.
